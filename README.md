**Dataset Overview**

This dataset provides information about female patients of Pima Indian heritage, aged 21 and older. It contains several health-related features and a binary outcome variable indicating the presence or absence of diabetes.

**Key Features:**

* **Pregnancies:** Number of pregnancies.
* **Glucose:** Plasma glucose concentration after a glucose tolerance test.
* **BloodPressure:** Diastolic blood pressure.
* **SkinThickness:** Triceps skinfold thickness.
* **Insulin:** 2-hour serum insulin level.
* **BMI:** Body Mass Index.
* **DiabetesPedigreeFunction:** Diabetes pedigree function.
* **Age:** Age of the patient.
* **Outcome:** Binary variable indicating diabetes (1) or no diabetes (0).

**Data Analysis**

**Univariate Analysis:**
* **Pregnancies:** Most patients had 0-2 pregnancies, with a few outliers.
* **Glucose:** The distribution is skewed, with some outliers at 0.
* **BloodPressure:** The distribution is relatively symmetric, with some outliers at 0.
* **Insulin:** The distribution is highly skewed, with many 0 values.
* **BMI:** The distribution is symmetric, with some outliers at 0.
* **DiabetesPedigreeFunction:** The distribution is highly skewed.
* **Age:** The distribution is skewed, with some outliers.
* **Outcome:** Approximately 65% of patients do not have diabetes.

**Multivariate Analysis:**
* **Glucose and Outcome:** A positive correlation exists between glucose levels and diabetes. Higher glucose levels are associated with a higher likelihood of diabetes.
* **BloodPressure and Outcome:** No significant correlation was found between blood pressure and diabetes.
* **BMI and Outcome:** A positive correlation exists between BMI and diabetes. Higher BMI is associated with a higher likelihood of diabetes.
* **Pregnancies and Outcome:** No significant correlation was found between the number of pregnancies and diabetes.

**Correlation Analysis:**
The correlation matrix reveals the strength and direction of relationships between features. Some features may have stronger correlations with the outcome variable than others.
